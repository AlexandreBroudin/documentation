## Locomotive Documentation Site

## Notes

- almost every page includes snippet 'page head' which contains 2 editable_texts with a priority of [8,9], so every editable_text 
above 'page_head' must have a priority under 8



## Todo / questions :

- footer quick links : keep them ? if so, make it absolute url to main site
- faq page : do we keep it ? if so, content = main site faq content ?
- guides :
  - multi site, upgrade to 2.0 : where do we put them ?
  - content from github repo parsing : ?
- fix typos due to html 2 markdown / \ + links
