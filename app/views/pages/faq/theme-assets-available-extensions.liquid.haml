  For instance, PDF files are not allowed. To change that, you need to override one of the methods of the Locomotive::ThemeAssetUploader class.

  First, create or modify the **config/initializers/engine_overrides.rb** file by adding the following piece of code:

      Locomotive::ThemeAssetUploader.class_eval do
        def extension_white_list
          %w(jpg jpeg gif png css js swf flv eot svg ttf woff otf ico htc pdf)
        end
      end

  Restart your engine, it is done.
